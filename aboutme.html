    <h2>Alfred</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Leo Alfred A. Mosquera. I am from the Philippines. 
        I started to love technology, especially computers, when I was 7. Since then, 
        I have tried to learn how to fix and troubleshoot desktop computer problems. 
        I found it very interesting to know more about software programs. 
        Unfortunately, software engineering is not available in the place where I reside. 
        There might be one, but it is in a private school that costs vast money to enroll. 
        <p>Although I am a computer enthusiast, I have little to no experience with coding. 
        Taking CSEPC 110 was a challenge for me. 
        Thankfully, through the guidance of our instructor and ever-supportive classmates, I got things done and learned the basics I needed. 
        I've learned from that experience that when things don't go our way, we should ask for help from others.</p> 
        <p>We are blessed with friends, families, and loved ones willing to help us along the way. 
        I believe that to succeed in this course, and I need to push my limits and do what I can. 
        If the going gets tough, I can always ask for help from others, especially our Heavenly Father. 
        We don't need to walk alone in this life or so in this course.</p>
