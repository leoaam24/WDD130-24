                <h1>Hi! My name is<br> <br>Leo ALfred A. Mosquera,</h1>
                <p>I am 26 years old and happily married to my lovely wife with our new baby. When I was five years old, my father died of lung cancer, and my mother was left alone to provide for her four children. After my father's death, we faced many hardships and difficulties. I can't recall a time when we had consistent bliss. As far as I remember, I learned some of the world's realities earlier in life. Which I believe was able to help me get through most of the challenges I have been through so far.<br> <br>My mother passed away because of COVID-19 in 2020, and my wife and I married after a month. I learned many things every day since I got married besides what I had already learned. I want to share my thoughts and perspectives on different aspects of life.</p>

                <h2 class="truth-title">What is <i>"Truth"?</i></h2>
                <p>What motivates me solely depends on the truth I believe and the priorities that matter most to me. For me, truth is either relative or absolute. The truth that is widely accepted or known, and the truth that is what it is. Many aspects of my life are relative truths. But I consider only a few absolute truths hold the foundation of hope and motivation in my life:<br>
                    <br>1.	I believe in a supreme being called God as our 'Heavenly Father.<br>
                    2.	We are not created by accident but by divine design.<br>
                    3.	Life doesn't start from birth and doesn't end with death.<br>
                    4.	There are consequences and rewards in everything that we do.<br>
                    <br>One needs to have something to believe or unbelief to form his motivation. Identifying truths in their life creates a solid foundation for their sense of purpose, thus creating the meaning of their existence. Identify the truths you believe and see the importance of your life.

                <h2 class="matters-title">What really Matters?</h2>
                <p>After knowing what truths you believe in, it is crucial to see what matters most in your life. Learning what matters will dictate your actions and why you do what you are doing now. It is imperative to know the truths first because those truths will lead you to filter what aspect of your life you should give importance. However, identifying priorities in your life is sometimes overwhelming. Start with what you are doing now and ask yourself, "Would this thing help me achieve or complement the truths I believe in?" This and other questions will point to another crucial part of forming one's motivation: "What do you want to become?"</p>

                <h2 class="becoming-title">What do you want to become?</h2>
                <p>This is not simply mean what career you want to pursue. It is what kind of person you want to become. What you want to become defines you based on what you believe and what matters most. In other words, you define who you are, not what others think about you. Having something you want to become will strengthen your resolve and motivation. One mistake that weakens one's motivation is letting others decide what you want to become. We are responsible for our growth and choices. In the end, others will see you based on what you do and firmly believe. There may be a gap between what you do and what you believe, yet, this is true for everyone. Understanding your motivations in life creates and shortens the bridge between this gap.</p>
