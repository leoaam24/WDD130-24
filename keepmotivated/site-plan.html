      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I created this page to help others become motivated despite the trials and challenges they're facing now. Although we all face different and unique experiences, we can always learn from each other. Thus, sharing my perspective through this site, hoping to help others see their problems differently. This page may also serve as my online journal, where I can share my thoughts and feelings on specific topics. Another purpose of this site is to showcase some of the books and resources that helped me during difficult times. Not everyone has a friend to reach out to. That's why my other aim is to inform the audience that they can reach me if they need someone to talk to and seek advice on matters that they need help with, not as a professional, but as a friend they can trust and be open with. They can select a schedule using this site to book their convenient time for a call. I hope this site instills perspective to help them find a way to solve their problems. This site revolves around assisting people in seeing that there is still hope and there is a way to obtain and know that there is hope.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site's target is the general audience. This means anyone who can access this site could benefit from its content. However, anyone aged 18 or below needs to digitally sign a term and agreement that they have their parents' consent when they want to book or schedule an appointment to talk with me. This is a way to protect the child's and my safety from any legal obligations. I chose the general audience as my target since my content is straightforward and applies to everyone. Everyone faces unique difficulties and challenges in their lives. Only some people are strong enough to handle all the problems on their own. Most of us seek a solution by seeing how others solved the same problem. Since this is the case, I am confident that the general audience will be a good fit for the content I have on my site. The site also welcomes curious readers who want to have a good read or want to expand their wisdom and perspective. Although the target is the general audience, I expect engagement from young single adults who seem more receptive to my content. The increasing number of suicide comes from youth to young adults. Knowing that's the case, I hope this site will be able to reach out to those age groups.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Hi! My name is Leo Alfred A. Mosquera,<br>
<br>I am (age) old and happily married to my lovely wife with our new baby. When I was five years old, my father died of lung cancer, and my mother was left alone to provide for her four children. After my father's death, we faced many hardships and difficulties. I can't recall a time when we had consistent bliss. As far as I remember, I learned some of the world's realities earlier in life. Which I believe was able to help me get through most of the challenges I have been through so far. My mother passed away because of COVID-19 in 2020, and my wife and I married after a month. I learned many things every day since I got married besides what I had already learned. I want to share my thoughts and perspectives on different aspects of life.<br>


<br>What motivates you?<br>

<br>What is "Truth"?<br>
<br>What motivates me solely depends on the truth I believe and the priorities that matter most to me. For me, truth is either relative or absolute. The truth that is widely accepted or known, and the truth that is what it is. Many aspects of my life are relative truths. But I consider only a few absolute truths hold the foundation of hope and motivation in my life:<br>
<br>1.	I believe in a supreme being called God as our 'Heavenly Father.<br>
<br>2.	We are not created by accident but by divine design.<br>
<br>3.	Life doesn't start from birth and doesn't end with death.<br>
<br>4.	There are consequences and rewards in everything that we do.<br>

<br>One needs to have something to believe or unbelief to form his motivation. Identifying truths in their life creates a solid foundation for their sense of purpose, thus creating the meaning of their existence. Identify the truths you believe and see the importance of your life.<br>

<br>What really Matters?<br>

<br>After knowing what truths you believe in, it is crucial to see what matters most in your life. Learning what matters will dictate your actions and why you do what you are doing now. It is imperative to know the truths first because those truths will lead you to filter what aspect of your life you should give importance. However, identifying priorities in your life is sometimes overwhelming. Start with what you are doing now and ask yourself, "Would this thing help me achieve or complement the truths I believe in?" This and other questions will point to another crucial part of forming one's motivation: "What do you want to become?"<br>

<br>What do you want to become?<br>
<br>This is not simply mean what career you want to pursue. It is what kind of person you want to become. What you want to become defines you based on what you believe and what matters most. In other words, you define who you are, not what others think about you. Having something you want to become will strengthen your resolve and motivation. One mistake that weakens one's motivation is letting others decide what you want to become. We are responsible for our growth and choices. In the end, others will see you based on what you do and firmly believe. There may be a gap between what you do and what you believe, yet, this is true for everyone. Understanding your motivations in life creates and shortens the bridge between this gap.<br>
